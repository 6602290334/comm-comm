### Martins recent work

Martin is in the 4th or 7th version of the new network stack for DAT desktop. He pushed a deep-work-in-progress version to [martinheidegger/p2p-networks][].

This is so difficult because he tries to entangle concepts that are tied together in hyperswarm or discovery-swarm as they have impact on users of DAT desktop.

He realised that what happens is that for networking DAT opens two difference systems: The discovery system and the publishing system. Each runs pretty much seperately.

For replication of a dat a server is started which accepts incoming connections.

It may be listening to one or many address, together with the discovery-key that it is looking for they discovery-system tells peers of the servers existence.

Once either...

- a connection is opened at the server...
- or a peer is discovered and a connection was opened to it...

the replication is initiated...

Which means there is a 2-dimensional dependent matrix of information flowing here `key Ã— address` for which a announce should go out to the dht network.

This also interacts with the issue seen at the last meeting. Namely: [one security check per connection][reference link] Which means that re-use of connections for sharing different dats is not viable. A new connection per DAT should needs to be maintained.

... anyways...

The tricky part with DAT desktop is that the configuration requires:

- User configurable at runtime
- Without errors (auto-reconnect)
- Persistable in case DAT-desktop or the computer shuts down.

And that drives the complexity quite high and Martin is struggling with keeping the complexity at bay. The current version of the rewrite the API should work (tm). We will see in a week or so, when everything is coded out.

### But did you know...

... that mafintosh has a new consultancy: [Hyperdivision][]

_(and we don't know what that means)_

### Duncan's work on the docs

Duncan continues on his [documentation of DAT][]. Martin commended him on the use of github for issues and mentioned the answer on the [issue of forking][]. Duncan is currently struggling to understand [bitfields & block tree digests][]. Together we tried to find out what that should mean, but we havn't figured that out yet.

_(Update: [comment on that issue](https://github.com/datprotocol/DEPs/pull/8/files#r246995097))_

## Konobi's use of DAT

Konobi uses DAT in combination with Abstract Code, trying to implement super-stable pieces of modular code stored in abstract syntax trees. With DAT as distribution model he tries to present AST's of code to always return the correct results.

### Questioning vocabulary

Konobi's problem often is with contextualizing of words. His example `feed` is used often in talking about DAT and he has difficulties to properly contextualize it.

When Martin attempted to summarize his explanation of _"what dat is"_, the phrase Hypercore dropped multiple times which resulted in the confusion that: _"We can't assume people know what a hypercore is."_ Triggering a rethinking on the naming for Hypercore.

Martin pointed out that Konobi's and Duncan's help would be very welcome in the [Nomenclature][] issue.
