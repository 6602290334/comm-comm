## Meeting Notes

- Diego starts introducing a new comm-comm meeting, the number 11.
  Comm-comm meetings are a place for and by the community. Here we can
  discuss ideas, share updates and findings, answer community questions,
  and much more. This place is yours.
- Georgiy says hi. Since Georgiy is contracting part time for the Dat project he
  shares some of his recent work and findings.
    - He recently published a [Datmobile](https://github.com/RangerMauve/datmobile) (pronounced like batmobile) native app. It's available on the
      [play
      store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.datmobile).
    - The app is currently like a Dat archive viewer but there are plans
      to make it more like a browser (beaker-like) for mobile.
    - Georgy has some interest on seeing how Dat internals will play with
      react-native. This is one of the reasons he choose not to use any
      other wrapper like nodejs-mobile or similar stuff.
    - He found there is a project called
      [rn-nodeify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rn-nodeify) which was
      really helpfull.
    - He also working on improving
      [dat-js](https://github.com/datproject/dat-js).
    - Make something like `rn-dat` is the final goal extracting the common
      pieces behind this experiment into a new general use module.
- Joseph says hi. He is the CTO of Littlstar, a company oriented to
  combine immersive media experiences with Dat.
- About Dat & React Native (rn).
  - Joseph mentions that he tried something in the past. But he choose
    a different strategy. He wanted to avoid monkey-patching React natibe
    stuff so he decided to use something like nodejs-mobile to avoid extra
    work but ended up dealing a lot with graddle and java :(
  - Joseph asks if anyone has run some crypto/sodium perf checks on
    react-native.
  - Georgy thinks the performance should be similar of a 2014 browser due
    to the underline engine.
  - Georgy shares
    a [link](https://github.com/react-native-community/jsc-android-buildscripts)
  - Joseph has used Dat with react-native on different devices (**even
    TVs!!**) and saw a reasonable performance. He has used a message
    channel to comunicate between rn and the nodejs layer succesfully (in
    a similar fashion to service workers).
  - differences between JS core engines on iOS and Android.
- Joseph talks more about his background on [ARA](https://ara.one/) and
  how they are using Dat.
  - Thanks to Dat they can share lots of data, like video games and
    immersive media with much more lower costs compared to classic CDNs.
  - This also allows them to create a credit system based on bandwidth
    sharing between peers. Basically if you share content you can have
    credit on your next purchase. It's like a reward system.
  - In the end the goal is to use ARA like Dat, to easily share content.
  - They are putting lot of efforts to make things easy to content
    creators.
  - End goal is also ubiquity regarding devices running their platform.
    This can means Dat running on broad spectrum of devices from a PS4 to
    an Android TV.
  - Georgy is quite interested on Dat + VR combination. He wants to play
    a bit with that combination in the next weeks.
- Dat & communication
  - All of us agree that the simpler you can share an idea the better. Dat
    helps us to do so. It's a cohesive project that you can easily explain
    to others and hopefuly build upon too. The similaties with
    a filesystem helps a lot on this effort.
  - Regarding communication, recently it has been some work around [Dat
    Docs site](https://docs.datproject.org/) and contributions are
    welcome!
- Signalhubs
  - Diego mentions at GEUT they are using and building lots of modules
    related to Dat these days. One of the current goals is to improve
    [signalhubws](https://github.com/soyuka/signalhubws). It's really good
    but we've found some issues around re-connections and we also want to
    explore connection re-use. So we hope to have a PR soon.
  - Georgy mentions that he has a similar interest. In the past he worked on
    something [similar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discovery-swarm-stream/v/1.0.0).
  - `dat-gateway` could be an option but works with hyperdrives only. It
    doesn't solve the websockets connection re-use problem.
  - The possibility to have a "standard" signal node it is very appealing.
    It will be interesting to create a repo, invite interested parties and
    collaborate/discuss on this unique solution to multiple problems.
  - Main concerns are: connection re-use, content privacy (make the
    gateway/signaling a less privileged node, it can't read messages), to
    work as a proxy is also desired, and finally work as an always-on
    node.

## Action Items

* [_For the hosts_] Try to advice these meetings at least one hour before
  the event. So more people can schedule and join. It is also interesting
  to explore other communication channels to share this meetings and
  related stuff.
* [_Signalhubs_] It will be great to create a repo to start the conversation
  around a standard signal/gateway node for Dat (& webapps using Dat).
  Maybe Diego, Georgy, Martin (@tinchoz49) (and any other of course) can
  get the ball rolling.
