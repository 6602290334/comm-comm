### Franz

- Shared interface for HyperDrive/Dat/etc.
- Datstore
    - needs to work on everything
    - Similar to random-access-* ?
- Replicating a hypercore should also give a list of hypercores for the stream?!
- We need three methods for a factory:
    - `replicate()`
        - Martin: `async replicate()`
        - Martin: `async replicate(feed)`
    - `ready()`
    - `discoveryKey`
        - Mauve: `async feeds()`
- How can we standardize storage?
    - Hypercore factories?
- {Discovery} > {Factory} > Instance

### Sam

- State of firefox
- Proof of concept works (in debugging env)
    - Regression in tcp sockets
- Main challenge
    - Linux & Mac prevent tcp socketing
- Browser extension works in context
    - Initial impl. works in child-context
        - Usually not allowed to do socket/network access
    - Needs to be moved to parent-context (message passing)
- Needs background
- https://cliqz.com/en/latest

### Edoo

- Share a dat link without private key
    - Other users can edit/download the data
    - Using different iframes - in chrome
- Mauve: We need multiwriter
- DAT is for me a solution to work without a server

### Multiwriter

- Mauve: Excited about the multiwriter work from [Andrew Wash]()
- Sam: What is the upgrade plan?
- Mauve: Discussion about an automatic upgrade ongoing
    - Maybe we use a [header]()

## Appeal to the community

- https://github.com/datprotocol/DEPs/pull/6
- https://github.com/datprotocol/DEPs/pull/49

## Dat-store as a service

- Dat-store is running as a service & it uses `os-service` for that (which probably doesn't work for Mac?)
- Martin: I want to use services too
    - But its hard because services should run in the background
    - Its hard because version conflicts between versions
    - Its hard because automatically starting & installing services
