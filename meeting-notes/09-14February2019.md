## Meeting Notes

- Diego starts introducing a new comm-comm meeting, the number 9.
  Comm-comm meetings are a place for and by the community. Here we can
  discuss ideas, share updates and findings, answer community questions,
  and much more. This place is yours.
- Rich introduces himself. He is one of the co-founders of
  [Wireline](https://www.wireline.io/). Wireline looks to solve or improve
  many problems on the decentralized area, with identity with one of
  those. He has also interest on ipfs, ipld and resilent networks.
- Chris says hi. He also works on Wireline. He has lot of experience
  working with communities and figuring out how to help the decentralized
  ecosystem grow.
- Georgy introduces himself. He is an independent contractor, currently
  working for the Dat Project. He is helping with docs, dat-js
  improvements and more.
- Martin is one of the [GEUT](https://github.com/geut) co-founders. He is
  also currently working for Wireline exploring new ideas and PoCs.
- Gina says hi. She is working at [Rumours](https://rumo.rs/), he also
  collaborates on CS&S and is one of the organizers of Dat nights.
- Roy introduces himself. He is working for Diglife. They have many
  interests, one of these is exploring "tech of trust" niche. He is also
  digging into Dat these days.
- Diego mentions the [new blog
  post](https://blog.datproject.org/2019/02/13/handshake-funding-brings-in-new-developers-for-dat/)
  from Dat Project about the recent grants. He asks Georgy, one of the
  grant holders, if he can tell us more about his new tasks on the Dat
  Project.
  - Georgy told us about [dat-js](https://github.com/datproject/dat-js)
    which is what he is working on these days. Making some improvements
    around. They need those fixes for the [internet archive](https://archive.org/), they plan to
    start using Dat on the web pretty soon. He also plans to start working
    on a new mobile app targeted for Android users similar to Beaker
    browser.
- A bit of identity on Dat
  - Roy asks Georgy about identity and how he plans to solve it.
  - Georgy mentions that his current work is not concerned about identity.
    He says that is a problem that can be solved at a different level, like
    application level. He also mention that Paul Frazee (Beaker) has been
    thinking about identity and it is a better candidate for that kind of
    questions.
  - Rich mentions that they are working trying to solve decentralized
    identity on Wireline. They have a credentials mechanism. They are also
    looking for some wallet implementations. Wireline is about to publish
    a new paper soon.
- libp2p & Dat
  - Rich mentions that they are working trying to solve decentralized
    identity on Wireline. They have a credentials mechanism. They are also
    looking for some wallet implementations. Wireline is about to publish
    a new paper soon.
  - Rich also mentions libp2p, the whole stack and ipld, how it is suitable
    for semantic web and deep linking. He is curious about the relation of
    these technologies and Dat.
  - Georgy mentions that in the past, he has some interest on adding
    libp2p support to Dat. But that idea never gain traction in the Dat
    community. He also doesn't think that currently Dat could go in that
    direction. In fact, new modules like the whole [hyperswarm](https://github.com/hyperswarm/) suggest the
    opposite.
  - Georgy also mentions some interest on
    [ActivityPubs](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/).
  - The discussion turns into differences between ipfs and Dat. Georgy
    mentions Dat is not content addressable and this is a key difference
    with ipfs.
  - Georgy also suggest, on this line, to explore
    [kappadb](https://github.com/kappa-db)
- Dat & streams
  - Martin mentions he likes how streams are used behind the curtains on all
    the hyperstack.
  - Georgy also likes this. He mentions how hypercore, a fundamental brick
    of the Dat stack is using streams on such a clear and powerful way.
  - Martin is concerned about the maximum number of connections that one
    app can hold. He is working on a new experimental social app that
    helps to follow different feeds and opens a new connection for every
    feed request. He saw these same patterns in other modules.
  - Georgy says that this is a common situation these days. Beaker and Dat
    CLI have been designed the same way. He thinks if there are lot of
    peers maybe they can help sharing the content and thus avoiding
    possible issues (too many connections on a single peer). He also says
    that the current limit is defined by the RAM.
- Dat & superpeers
  - Diego mentions that in the torrent world the superpeer concept is more
    stablished thant in the Dat world. It could be nice to explore more
    that direction. (For more context here, Diego was refering more to
    a like always-on node than to a more traditional superpeer). These
    kind of nodes can be used to extend the power of a P2P app.
  - Georgy adds that hashbase.io is one of the most famous Dat superpeers.
    He also mentions that there is a merge coming to `dat-gateway` pretty
    soon (based on the work made by Garbados), this new merge will bring
    lots of features and he even plans to use this inside `dat-js`. He
    also hopes this new release will make dat-gateway more easy to use.
- A new app
  - Diego introduces [caracara](https://caracara.hashbase.io/) a new app
    he has been working on. It is a super simple collaborative editor
    based on Dat. It was made using React, Dat and Automerge. Diego is
    currently working on technical article that will come along with app.
- Work with Dat
  - Georgy asks if anyone is working for a company using Dat.
  - Rich mentions Wireline. They are solving many similar problems on the
    decentralized ecosystem and they are willing to see if Dat could help
    them. He is also interested in funding some open source work. You can
    reach rich at wireline to know more.
  - Brandon says hi. He works for [ARA](https://ara.one/) a content
    platform using blockchain to guarantee ownership and Dat for
    publishing.
    - Georgy asks why not ipfs instead of Dat?
    - Brandon says that the characteristics of preserving a history of Dat
      makes it a clear winner instead of ipfs. Keeping doc changes history
      is quite important for a content platform and Dat makes thing easier
      on this.
    - Eric shares some links about ARA: https://ara.one/,
      https://github.com/AraBlocks, app.ara.one/mac/latest, app.ara.one/windows/latest
    - Brandon also mentions that ARA will have a coin based on ETH.
- Aral joins! He mentions **hypha**. He said that while creating hypha he
  was learning about the whole hyper-\* stack. Hypha aims to improve the
  authentication part of decentralized part of P2P app. Aral writes about
  his progress on his
  [blog](https://ar.al/2019/02/12/hypha-spike-persistence-1/).
- Dat Multiwriter progress
  - Max and Aral asks if anyone knows about the progress on the new Dat
    with multiwriter support.
  - Diego mentions that Andrew Osherof will be working on that part.
    [hypertrie](https://github.com/mafintosh/hypertrie) which has been
    recently released is one of the modules that will be used to
    accomplish this.
- Georgy asks Aral about the relation between his work on hypha and the
  SOLID protocol.
- Aral mentions that he is aware of SOLID but it wasn't an inspiration.
  The key difference that he sees is that hypha uses an
  **underprivileged** always-on node. This node also helps with
  _findability_. It relies on websockets and signalhubs.
