### How to get compensated in p2pland?

- Nina: more and more people are getting money via grants to create, not necessarily a direct exchange for goods/services
- Make donation/payment frictionless and immediately obvious within projects and apps
- [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/)
    - BTW: [Dat on Open Collective!](https://opencollective.com/dat)
    - ALSO: [Beaker Browser on Open Collective!](https://opencollective.com/beaker)
- [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/todrobbins)
- Mauve: cooperative/worker-owned Patreon(s): people with common goals/vision share in management and success
- Nina: we need to buy from each other, establish supply chains between communities instead of relying on outside growth
- Stephen: [BackYourStack](https://backyourstack.com/), "Discover the Open Source projects* your organization is using that need financial support."
- Paul: generally, consumers are not willing to spend much on software or services; focus on getting the "whales" instead of the individual consumers
    - [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com/), "A managed open source subscription backed by creators and maintainers"
- Nina: there are needs in this space, but still a lot of generous people who don't know where to invest their money

### Dat Gateway

- [`dat-gateway`](https://github.com/garbados/dat-gateway): In-memory Dat to HTTP gateway
    - <https://dat.bovid.space/>
    - <https://gateway.mauve.moe/>
- [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) is pretty great
