## People

- [Martin](https://github.com/martinheidegger)
- [Peg](https://github.com/ameba23) - found the place Scuttlebut; Working on [dark crystal](https://darkcrystal.pw), [github repos](http://github.com/blockades)
- [Franz](https://github.com/frando) - works with Matthias on Archipel. High-level API to work with different data structures. Like Hyperdrives or HyperGraphs.

## Introductions

Frando is thinking to extract some of the high-level APIs based on hypercores into its own module. 

Peg is thinking about sharing secrets using Scuttlebut.
Making it easy to share DAT keys. Interested in 
distributed data storages.

## Topics

- Current understanding of Peg
    - You refer to DAT's by the public keys
    - It is append-only
    - hyper-db is a mutable datbase
    - comparable to ipfs but 
    - Same image: same hash in scuttlebut
- How does deduplication work in DAT
    - https://github.com/datproject/docs/issues/135
    - Basically the state is:
        1. Not done in DAT yet, but possible in future
        2. Client only deduplication
        3. Deduplication in the file tree
        4. Deduplication in a separate hypercore
        5. Deduplication with hypercore's per hash-trie (similar in concept to: 
        6. Deduplication by always referencing the ipfs version of the file
- How do blocks work in DAT
    - Blocks are currently equal 
- Idea of a media-file metadata indexing system.
    - Annotation around files by their hashes
    - Meta-information around globally identifyable resources

- Frando wants to create high-level api for hypercores:
    - https://github.com/arso-project/archipel/blob/betterbackend/packages/app/src/features/graph/Tag.js#L34
    - Parts:
        - ↓ Feed (aka. Hypercore)
        - ↓ Structures (wrapper around feeds)
            - Consists of:
                - RPC-API
                - Internal API for controlling
        - ⤓ Archives (addressable through a link)
    - Frando is busy for the next week (for a presentation)
    - Then share a concept of the shared hyperstack model
    - Then they will export it in repository
    - Martin mentions that there are other implementions doing RPC and feedback of the community would be really good.
