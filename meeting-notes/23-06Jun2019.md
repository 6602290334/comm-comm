## Meeting Notes
- [Hypercore](https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore) API on [Beaker](https://beakerbrowser.com/)
    - Lots of projects running on top of hypercore like [Cabal](https://cabal-club.github.io/). They don't work on Beaker. How can we improve this?
    - [Peersockets](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker-core/pull/6). Raw access to discovery swarm. There are some blockers (sec)
    - MVP on hypercores on beaker. Try something like Cabal in Beaker.
    - Follow the roadmap here: https://github.com/datproject/planning/issues/9
    - Data management inside of Beaker
    - Paul mention the idea of FS metaphor inside beaker
    - Share hyperdrives with others
    - Improve this by using **mounts** (coming up next)
    - "mount hypercore to folders"
    - Georgiy shares: https://github.com/RangerMauve/dat-archive-web
    - Trade offs btw beaker apps and other-traditional-browsers development.
        - Dietrich mentions network stack as a current limitation.
        - Dietrich has an interest on a possible bridge btw dat and ipfs worlds.
        - We can learn from each others (patterns mostly)
        - Georgiy mentions the dat on the web work he has been doing ([dat-js](https://github.com/datproject/dat-js), [webrtc-swarms](https://github.com/mafintosh/webrtc-swarm), [websockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API))
            - [discovery-swarm-stream](https://github.com/RangerMauve/discovery-swarm-stream) opens a websocket to a server and connect to the discovery-swarm from there.
            - interest on improving the number of connections of a swarm => https://ranger.mauve.moe/graph-mst-viz
            - [mMST](https://github.com/RangerMauve/mostly-minimal-spanning-tree): Mostly-Minimal Spanning Tree
        - Bridges between webrtc swarms and non-webrtc.
            - https://github.com/RangerMauve/discovery-swarm-web
        - hyperswarm will bring lots of improvements. E.g.: Better dht, Hole punching.
- [dat-sdk](https://github.com/datproject/planning/issues/7). Georgiy will be working this month on a possible dat-sdk, like a solid/easy foundation for developing dat-apps.
- Paul mentions "web platform as a node competitor"
    - georgiy shares: https://github.com/RangerMauve/webrun
- new horizons for the web. Life outside the mono-browsers. Web in other environments: beaker,
    - Dietrich mentions the difficulties around building everything a browser API first (from his experience working on Firefox OS)
        - core services were implemented as userland services.
- dat integration between different apps/services/CLIs/etc
    - standardize a (unique) daemon
    - Dat-SDK will help too
    - protobufs usage is being considered
    - New FUSE based filesystem integration. Mount a Dat as a folder in your OS

    - https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperfs
    - http://p2p-fs.sourceforge.net
- Dietrich shares https://github.com/fabricedesre/servonk
- Beaker's [Unwalled-garden](https://unwalled.garden)
    - A protocol part of the next version of beaker (Blue)
    - Models/schemas for social apps. Like a layer for building social apps.
    - https://pfrazee.hashbase.io/blog/unwalled-garden
    - It will enable permissions for apps
    - It will improve the app ecosystem for beaker. Making things easier. Moving beyond statics sites.
    - Like an standard way for apps to reuse (social) data.
