Why Dat event @ trust berlin?

- People that couldn't join at DTN
- Hangout and Hack
- Have a few casual talks

## Who am I
Joe Hand (works as emoji ☕️✋)  

My History:

- Developer on CSS/HTML ebooks
- Project Manager
- Researcher
- DAT Developer
- Lots difference

What do I do (to get paid):

- Co-Executive Director
- 5 projects now at [CSS](https://codeforscience.org/)
    - The Problem: Sustainable OSS work
    - Goal: How to develop leader diversity
    - How to support an infrastructure
- Talk to Joe if you have a project you want to work on

**The important parts**

History:

1. ~~Originally: Git for DATA~~
2. ~~Data sharing for researchers~~
3. ~~Powerful data sharing from your desktop~~
4. ~~A p2p protocol powering next gen web~~
5. Community driven project for distributed data synchronization

How to connect to the users:

- Each stage tries to identify a new user set.
- We didn't set out to decide the protocol
- "pivots" were to follow users

Pain in the DAt's:

- Three common problems:
    1. Networking
    2. Performance
    3. Multi-writer
- User/Dev Problems:
    - Keeping DAT alive
        - Dat Server
        - Daemons
    - Discovery + Debugging
        - Dat Doctor++
        - Deploy Discovery Tools
        - Dats on the Server
- We need to focus first on the developer experience.

Researcher Problems:
- Syncing DATs around
- Automated Transfers

- Globus on [GridFTP](http://toolkit.globus.org/toolkit/docs/latest-stable/gridftp/)


I want to know things people need: What are the pain points?

We didn't measure DAT things yet, but we started to measure (recently we checked the homepage and it had 1/2 million hits/month)

## [Martín Acosta](https://github.com/tinchoz49) - 2h31m00

Hello, we have been working on [wireline](https://www.wireline.io/), a collaborative p2p platform. Uses DAT in the background.

Issues that we faced:
- Multiwriter support
- Load feeds by demand
- Custom rules for replicate feeds
- Support access control for items/pads

Concept: Megafeed
- Manage multiple feeds
- Feeds are stored by name, you can use namespaces: /feed/max
- Load feeds by glob patterns: /feed/**
- Persist metadata in hypertrie

It works/uses kappa

Concept: Party
- A Party is an abstraction to provide multi-writer capability by grouping and replicating feeds that belongs to the same party.
- It follows a set of replication rules known as: Party rules.

The modules will soon be opensourced (a few weeks maybe?) on the [github repository](https://github.com/wirelineio).

## [Gina](https://github.com/whoisgina) - 2h37m10

I work at a design studio called [rumo.rs](https://rumo.rs) and I am a designer & frontend developer.

I organize the DATNight event in portland, oregon which is I want to keep democratic and together with the community I want to sellect.

We had 3 events:

1. Traditional event at Mozilla. Which I wanted to make a little tacticle showing a few problems.
2. Danielle Robinson was speaking about DAT in science.
3. Study hall, free-form event with a small intro in the beginning. With more information.

I would love to talk to everyone and for people to join the discussion.

## [Ranger Mauve](https://github.com/rangermauve) - 2h42m25

Karissa: Ranger Mauve was active on the internet and we're like: we should probably figure out how we should pay Ranger Mauve

In "Snowcrash" they had this cool idea of "Metaverse" - a 90s VR cyberspace. The idea was that the system was local. Compared to the current VR ecosystem that is based on servers and siloed. The SDK's are all proprietary and the corporate systems etc. and I have been looking at other systems in the web VR space.

CryptoVoxels is this cool game we made. Obviously VR in the web isn't that big of a thing. What this does is connect it in a multi-player environment.

It runs over the local WiFi. It uses MDNS in to find players & direct sockets to communicate over DAT.

It is built with quite a bit of code, but the game itself exposes quite little code to the end-user. It has an a-frame system that is html-like and allows the specification of a scene with elements that automatically communicate the location over the system

## [Mathias Buus](https://github.com/mafintosh) - 2h49m15

5 minute version of the 40 min talk @ DTN: https://mafintosh.github.io/dtn-2019/#0

Summary:
- Emil works on [HSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module) support.
- [Hyperdrive 10](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperdrive) - mostly [Andrew](https://github.com/mafintosh/andrewosh) with a [HAMT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_array_mapped_trie) → log4(entry) performance.
- Future: INode support in hyperdrive for good random access writes.
- Future: Fuse support but UX is not great yet. To improve [fuse-friends](https://github.com/fuse-friends)

## [Paul Frazee](https://github.com/pfrazee) - 3h04m55

Problems Paul is working on:

- People have a hard time to find content
- Too difficult to build interesting things on it. Needs to be simpler to build things.

I want us to have a magical big computer system that is social.
Users should be able to fork things quickly and the data and 

Turning this into a giant big (social) computing network.

Paul wants to go it in that way: decentralizing ownership at the software layer.

Things done:

1. Editor directly in the Beaker Browser. And people surprisingly love it.
2. Improvements to data management. With a new file editor etc.
3. Personal identity created in Beaker Browser directly that allows publishing of status changes directly to friends and create a social network around it.

### Application Stack "Unwalled Garden"

Toolkit to build social applications (e.g. beaker.social improvement on fritter)

### Experiment "Search"

Automatically indexes webpages of people that you follow. 

_Followed by a walk through of the new editor and beaker.social in the next Beaker Browser_

### Questions

- "How easy is it to change the profile?" - It could be done easily but Paul didn't do it yet
- "LittleSnitch sometimes makes Beaker go nuts. How do you increase the privacy/security of Beaker Browser for malicious web applications?" - Opportunities to improve this: unwalled garden is high-level and what Paul probably wants to do is using a APP-based model. A type system is built at the basic that allows different access to different parts of the data and capabilities.
- "Would it make sense to connect unwalled.garden to federated networks" - The network most interesting for Paul would be activity.pub. Maybe it could be bridged but it's hard to find.

## [Irina Bolychevsky](https://github.com/shevski) - 3h23m15

Not talk about DAT :).

She worked on CKAN. 

6 years ago she founded redecentralize. Because all friends

Worried about diversity, decision and choice.

They have been working on publishing the decentralized projects. For that they did founder interviews, a conference and a list of [awesome alternative internet things](https://github.com/redecentralize/alternative-internet).

### Questions

"Have you held hackathons around that?" - There was a activity at the conference but we would be interested in having this

We built a tool that allows

### Issues that we are facing

- People don't use Beaker yet.

## [Eileen Wagner](https://twitter.com/bumblblu) - 3h39m24

I do UX stuff™️

Collecting UX patterns in different protocols. On any level you want.
In the true spirit of decentralization Ailene is about to create an open design pattern library.

And there was a space to draw metaphors of p2p at the venue. Maybe even have a zine.

## [Substack](https://github.com/substack) - 3h41m45

Since december 2018 he works on https://peermaps.org - concretely his first rust based database. It is in a very rough state now, but it processes 1mio additions in 1.4secs and very quickly allows merges as the data is prepared for the a distributed map.

(Demo for DTN showed)

## [Franz K.H.](https://github.com/Frando) - 3h47m22

About [arso](https://github.com/arso-project):
- History preservation from below
- Support of minority groups
- Community owned

Problems are:
- Data is stored in blogs, feeds, website that are often lost over time.
- Reduce cost, stress and effort of running a website and make sure its kept.
- Reduce effect of forking.

Prototype: [Archipel](https://github.com/arso-project/archipel)

Challenges:
- metadata is hard
- multiwriter is hard
- resilience & health monitoring
- UX

Say hi: https://arso.xyz

## [Paolo Voltra](https://github.com/heapwolf) - 3h52m30

Paolo had this crazy idea to implement DAT in C++ which is probably not as good as the rust implementation but it is implemented in a very Node-style way, using even async like constructs and npm-like dependency management:

[C++ DAT](https://github.com/datcxx)

He is looking for people interested in that and thinks it will definitely add to the DAT eco system.

Fundraising! Fun(d)! Raising!

- It can be fun.
- It can be useful.

Approach it seriosly may mean less chance.

How can we be friends with our funders. Funders want to be friends.
Making friends can be hard: Other ways to say this: Wanna get only funding
from people that are friends.

Prevent corruption issues.

Prepare a menu of funding:
- Options on how to fund.
- And prepare for friends.

Don't waste time of friends by listening to what they need.

- Work through the no's!

Do you want help with funding stuff? Contact Karissa. (Its her J.O.B.)
Doing good in the community? We wanna help you!
