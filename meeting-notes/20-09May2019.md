    - Nice chance to hang out with the Dat team.
    - Some members of the GEUT team will be there. Say hi!
- NodeConf Colombia update
    - Diego is working on a talk about Dat
    - It will be like a hands-on talk with some insights on dat-js and dat-node
    - Mauve advise to take a look on [dat-archive](https://github.com/RangerMauve/dat-archive-web) instead of dat-js
        - this approach can work on beaker and outside beaker.
        - it will work better out-of-the-box.
    - Mauve mentions some ideas on using peers as gateways (similar to how a dht works)
    - Mauve has an interest of adding dat-archive API support into https://exokit.org/
- Wireline will be sponsoring some Dat progress
    - Martin mention how they are using Dat inside wireline.
    - Some of the stuff they made using Dat includes: signaling servers (improvements), kappa usage, Gql API for interacting with kappa.
    - "decentralize the signaling" is one of the problems/improvements that GEUT will try to solve for wireline.
    - Mauve mentions similarities with the idea of a federated signaling server. Maybe similar to activity pub.
    - It is important to encrypt the data before hits the signaling server.
    - cblgh mentions that maybe it's worth it to give it a look to mixnet for ideas around better signaling servers: https://katzenpost.mixnetworks.org/
    - Mauve shares https://zeronet.io/
        - similar to https://github.com/RangerMauve/mutable-webtorrent

- Running a business on the P2P world / financial questions
    - This is an open question, how a company will monetize something on a P2P world. It is also an ethical question.
    - How do peers finance their p2p work in general right now? Freelance, full-time job, secret stash of cryptos?

    - Jin mentions the idea of using the [BAT](https://basicattentiontoken.org/) model.
    - https://ara.one/
