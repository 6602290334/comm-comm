## What is old is new again
by [@whoisgina](https://github.com/whoisgina)

**The way we build reflects how things are BROKEN**

- Decentralize the development of the decentralized web
- Language matters: decentralized vocab is **HARD** and confusing for those who don't know. _(Hard to join in)_
- **Forests**:
    - are cooperative + connected through a network _(of roots)_
    - are like socialists
    - are there to help each other grow.

- Computer Literacy
    - Perpetuating the needs of the many over the needs of the few
    - _NOT accessible_

## Security (and _privacy_) in _Peer-to-Peer_ systems
by [@gpestana](https://github.com/gpestana)


- [Distributed Hash Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table)
    - Decentralized Key-Val Storage
    - Init nodes checks if nodes in its network have the info in it.
    - Each node then behaves the same
    - Each node is a _routing table_
- focus DHT:
    - **Metadata is the _most_ vulnerable**
    - Data request: Requesting data from a single user requires other users to ALSO provide information
        - `1)` metadata request
        - `2)` data/request
        - `1)` metadata request
        - etc.

- Alternatives _(to DHT)_
    - Delegated Encrypted Requests (DHT + _onion_ layer)
    - Plausible Deniability through Noise (_flip a coin method_ + could also be built on top of DHT)
    - Friend to friend routing (only contact _nodes you know_)
    - [Octopus DHT lookup](https://nikita.ca/papers/octopus-icdcs12.pdf) (get _full routing_ table when connecting nodes)
    - [Oblivious transfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblivious_transfer) (uses [_Quorum_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quorum) for routing table)

## State of DAT
by [@mafintosh](https://github.com/mafintosh)

- [Hypercore](https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore): append-only-log
- [Hyperdrive](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperdrive): abstraction for _file-system_ → 2 Hypercores: metadata + content
- [Hyperdrive 10](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperdrive/pull/233):
    - Dealing with slow & large writes
    - uses [_HASH TRIES_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashed_array_tree)

- `1)` path is split 
- `2)` each part is hashed
- `3)` concatenated into one (where each points to part location)
- `4)` The combination is added to the append-only-log

- MOUNTs one 'big' hyperdrive combines multiple hyperdrives with separate file systems
- ! implementing _random-access-writes_ (important for swapping DBS: hyperdrive + SQL/MongoDB)

[![Decentralisation and its Discontents - Notes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/914122/59494444-1c3eec80-8ec8-11e9-9cc3-cafa1df8c4e7.jpg)](https://twitter.com/_lrlna/status/1129714362242031616)

## Decentralisation and its Discontents
by [@ana0](https://github.com/ana0)


- Hub-in-Spoke in Flight Routes - resembles _scale free_ model of (de)centralisation
- Lorenz Coefficient: THE WHY? ![Lorenz Coefficient](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Economics_Gini_coefficient2.svg/1920px-Economics_Gini_coefficient2.svg.png)
- Original decentralized network: [ARPANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET) - built to withstand <br> _(par・ti・tion・ing)_
- Scalability Trilemma:
    1. Decentralisation
    2. Scalability
    3. Security
- Technology: pinnacle of _centralised_ manufacturing
    → manufacturing follows _economies of scale_ → hard to decentralise
- Decentralisation is mostly used in: Political + Organization contexts
    **Centralisation** ⇄ **Decentralisation** (cyclical decentralising)
- Decentralisation in open source projects: e.g. DAT: 51% of commits by 6% of commiters

[![Beaker Blue Alpha - Notes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/914122/59494415-0af5e000-8ec8-11e9-83bd-57745a089533.jpg)](https://twitter.com/_lrlna/status/1129768344352116736)

## Beaker Blue Alpha
by [@pfrazee](https://github.com/pfrazee)

- NEW in Beaker:
    - Data/File Manager
    - Source code editor
    - Decentralised search

- Decentralised Browser
- software is developed by USERS (possibility)
- How Hypermedia works:
    - (URL based) `dat://butts.com` can be many things:
        - `/` the whole drive
        - `/a/` a folder
        - `/a/b.txt` a file
    - **Crawler** crawls files on mulitple hyperdrives (REQUEST→ CRAWLER)
- **Unwalled Garden**
    - Based on file system
    - Allows this to be based on views
    
    ```
    [Hyperdrive] + [Crawler]
         ↓             ↓
    [-- Unwalled Garden ---]
       ↑ (interfacing) ↑
      [----- Users -----]
    ```

    (works like API)

[![DAT on the web - Notes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/914122/59494387-fa456a00-8ec7-11e9-821d-a9502f316ccc.jpg)](https://twitter.com/_lrlna/status/1130099868494643201)

## DAT on the web
by [@rangermauve](https://github.com/rangermauve)

→ DAT tl;dr: Filesystem

    ← write
    → read
    = Hyperdrive

- Data storage has to be configured! 
    - Uses [random-access-*](https://github.com/random-access-storage) interface
    - ... BUT this does **not** work on the web _(although [browserify](https://github.com/browserify/browserify) gets you a long way)_

- The WEB options:

    1. [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/): networking replacement

        - with help from browserify DAT is stored in browser memory
        - shared with others via p2p

        Issues: SLOW + Storage can not be persisted (albeit being fast)

    2. WebSockets: straight up comm with server
    
        - Websocket → DAT Server → p2p
            - [dat-js](https://github.com/datproject/dat-js)
            - [dat-gateway](https://github.com/pfrazee/dat-gateway)

        - gateway loads hyperdrive locally: potential for snooping
        - geared towards only hyperdrive
    
    3. Combination of both! (aka. use this!)

        - Mulitplexing p2p connections through a websocket server
        - The websocket connection is not used to directly replicate hyperdrive
        - instead: peer search params
        - Connection to swarm uses 1 connection for all DATs

        → better privacy + can multiplex

- [DAT.js](https://github.com/datproject/dat-js) makes easy to work with non-beaker environment

## Peer-2-Peer Cartography
by [@substack](https://github.com/substack)

- [Peer Maps](https://peermaps.org/) → Replacement for centralised maps: e.g. google maps
    - GOAL: 
        1. view maps on website
        2. available offline
        3. longevity
- [KAPPA architecture](http://milinda.pathirage.org/kappa-architecture.com/) (append-only log): allows views to be built from log data.
- COM _(→ eyros)_・PONE _(→ georender)_・NTS _(→ swarmhead)_
- [**Eyros**](https://github.com/peermaps/eyros): Multi-dimensional spatial database
    
    Combines a few structures:

    1. [**KD-Tree**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree): multidimensional
    2. [**B-Tree**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B_tree): children w. multiple nodes
    3. [**LOG-structured merge trees**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-structured_merge-tree): When tree fills up, combine until you hit an EMPTY tree
    4. [**Interval tree**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_tree): Store intervals instead of points

- [**Swarmhead**](https://github.com/peermaps/swarmhead):
    - Cooperative computing cluster
    - using _spare capacity_ on existing computers that are not always online.
    - _no_ single points of _failure_
    - long lasting → as long as there is _care_

- [**Georender**](https://github.com/peermaps/georender):
    - use _webgl buffers_ as database queries
    - small N' of draw cells

[![Webtorrent lessons - Notes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/914122/59494275-c79b7180-8ec7-11e9-9ec5-0984b0716f97.jpg)](https://twitter.com/_lrlna/status/1130418431537418240)

## Webtorrent lessons → bittorrent in the browser
by [@feross](https://github.com/feross)

- Initial project plan:
    1. Make [Bittorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) work
    2. Then ship it to the web
- **Lessons**:
  - Plan for least technical users
      - makes for a more accessible project
      - makes _it usable_ for _non-nerds_
  - Incremental improvements
      - provides incremental _happiness_ to users along the way
  - Centralising coordination is OK
      - with large projects and many contributors, meetings could work?
  - Worse is better
      1. Make things work
      2. Then make it better

      gets people interested in the project _early_

      e.g. WebRTC is not perfect **but** makes it easy to argue for better p2p
    
  - Ignore the nerds

      Super technical ideas make it hard for non-technical users to use → **Inaccessible**
