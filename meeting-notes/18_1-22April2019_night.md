DAT night was mostly a work night/study hall!

@whoisgina gave a brief intro to Dat & Beaker Browser and why we should be exploring this way of working and building.

They split into groups.
- @whoisgina shared these zines: [`dat://classic-notebook-style.solarpunk.cool/`](dat://classic-notebook-style.solarpunk.cool/) and [`dat://home-page.angblev.com/`](dat://home-page.angblev.com/)
- some attendees made editable copies of them in Beaker Browser and started making their own. 
- A lot of the attendees brainstormed what an online/offline Dat zine could be about/look like with @calebmisclevitz; there are photos of that below!
- I set up Dat on a Raspberry Pi in the back of the room (following [this guide](https://github.com/new-computers/guides/blob/master/guides/installing-dat-raspberry-pi.md), thanks @new-computers), and had some interesting conversations with people about what we could use it for (always on peer! streaming video of future events! resource hub for the community! a concert?!)
- Lots of people eating snacks, chatting, working on side projects, and helping each other out!
