# Dat meetups at 35C3

## 2018-12-28

### Who's here
* Franz ([https://github.com/Frando](Frando)) - Archipel (https://archipel.hashbase.io) (developing an decentralized archiving tools based on Dat)
* Sergej, deep web research
* Fabio, new to Dat
* Silvio, reading about Dat
* Luke, curious
* [..] working on memex type tools
* Martin, has been trying out Dat
* Alex ([cblgh](https://github.com/cblgh)), working on [Cabal](http://cabal.chat) (Chat based on Dat) and other Dat things
* KawaiiPunk uses Dat to share music
* Stana (selv), documentation writing
* Justin, interested in dat
* Jacob ([powersource](https://github.com/powersource)) - working on a [video sharing app](https://github.com/viddist/viddist)
* Kyle, works on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/), also focus on getting p2p apps into browsers
* Neil, working on cryptography in Dat (e.g. hardware tokens)
* mathias (mafintosh) works on Dat internals

and others

### organizational

There's a working group for dat already (to take protocol decisions) and now there's also a community group ([dat-land/comm-comm](https://github.com/dat-land/comm-comm)) to have more structured discussions with weekly meetups

also more money coming from enterprise these days.

if all goes well (and it looks like that) next year can be all about tech

### what happens at dat core modules

many scaling fixes e.g. in hypercore

the new network stack is coming together (hyperswarm) with a dht and transport encryption using NOISE
replaces hyperdiscovery/disocvery-swarm which either used bittorent dht or a central signaling server

[NOISE protocol](http://noiseprotocol.org/) will be used for transport encryption on top of hypercore-protocol (which is already encrypted)
* why that?
* currently: dat key is "address" and "password" - so there's basically no way to revoke access. NOISE standardizes an additional transport encryption layer (which is also good for stability etc) - there every peer has a key pair, and you can whitelist which peers you want to share with (white/blacklist)

### different ways to use the dat stack

* browsers, cli, [libdweb](https://github.com/mozilla/libdweb#status-in-active-development)
* [hyperlib](https://github.com/Frando/hyperlib)" (to be expanded)

#### libdweb

* currently firefox experimental api (in nightly)
* exposes tcp and udp sockets to web extensions
* still really unsure how that could be published non-experimental
* not something to expect to be available in non-dev releases soon

alternative for running the dat stack in the browser:
* file storage is already doable with indexeddb in might get better soon with standardization of chrome file api
* networking: likely would still need a proxy, either a locally running daemon or a remote proxy. could use a service worker to work transparently

### Who's here

* Franz / frando
* magnus / ralphtheninja
* andreas / adzialocha / part of blatt3000.de - artist group doing interactive decentralized festivals. experimenting with distributed technologies. also talk on this at 8pm today in [1komona](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2018/wiki/index.php/Room:Komona_Thunderdome)
* Jacob ([powersource](https://github.com/powersource)) - working on a [video sharing app](https://github.com/viddist/viddist)
* alex / cblgh / working on various dat things, cabal (chat app), a dat radio, and others
* kristoffer / krl / working on a (rust-based) database focused on storing immutable hashes (key: dat-hash, value: content)

### Presentation of projects

* [archipel](https://archipel.hashbase.io)  - decentralized file sharing (website outdated) - more coming soon. ([github](https://github.com/archipel-somoco/archipel))
* [hoffnung3000](https://github.com/adzialocha/hoffnung3000) - festival site with resources / places / calendar - so far "classic" stack (node, postgresql, react) but andreas wants to port it to use dat
* [andreas](https://github.com/adzialocha) writing a toy dat rust port to learn right now (will be published as a tutorial)

### Meetup 2019

let's have a gathering soonish and hack, share, spin ideas
like a week long, somewhere in middle europa

Location ideas

* kopenhagen, berlin (well reachable for many people)
* freiburg
