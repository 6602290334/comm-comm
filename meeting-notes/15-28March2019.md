Those were summarized on rangermauve's [comment](https://github.com/dat-land/comm-comm/issues/38#issuecomment-473017953) on issue #38. There is a plan to tackle some of them [here](https://github.com/dat-land/comm-comm/issues/38#issuecomment-476322301). You are welcome to help us on any of these actions or propose others solutions.
