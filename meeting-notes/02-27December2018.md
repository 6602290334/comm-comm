# dat protocol Community communication 

27 Dec 2018

## People

* Martin Heidegger (@martinheidegger)
* VT Duncan (@vtduncan)

## Agenda

* Catching up

## Meeting Notes

* Discussion about @vtduncan 's latest [work documenting DAT](https://github.com/vtduncan/how-dat-works).
    Particularly the structure of document. It was martin's concern that the document explains trivial things
    as well as hidden magic equally well; Making it hard to figure out what secrets are hidden. Duncan
    explained his methodology _(how trial & error & reading code turns into a hacked-together DAT implementation)_
    and that he focusses on a good reading flow.
* @martinheidegger elaborated on his approach to a general-purpose daemon and that he was stuck in the problem
    on shared sockets - segwaying into...
* Discussion about the handshake in the hypercore protocol: It seems to both like the hypercore protocol only does a handshake
    once for per peer connection and it might be able to retreive other, unrelated cores with the same stream 
    (https://github.com/mafintosh/hypercore-protocol/blob/7c79430ac108c758b50586fdda42bf8bfe533406/index.js#L153-L168)

## ACTION ITEMS

* Looking into possible security issue in the hypercore handshake in combination with multiple cores.
